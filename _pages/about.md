Hello everyone! My name is Meshkat, which means 'placeholder for light' in my native language. Welcome to my personal webpage!

Feel free to check out my **_GitHub repository_** here: [_GitHub_](https://github.com/meshkatshb)

I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Engineering** and a Master's degree in **Information Technology Engineering** from the [_University of Tehran_](https://ut.ac.ir), [_College of Interdisciplinary Sciences and Technology_](https://cist.ut.ac.ir), graduating with a GPA of 3.61/4.0. My Master's thesis titled: **"Text Summarization with Graph Neural Networks,"** explored scalable methods for long-text summarization and highlighted the importance of transparent AI models.. My research interests include _Large Language Models_, _Natural Language Processing_, _Artificial Intelligence (AI)_, _Machine Learning (ML)_, _Social Network Analysis_, and _Software Engineering_.

I am currently looking for PhD positions in Europe in the field of Generative AI, NLP, Software Engineering, and Graphs.

# My Expertise

- **General:** NLP, GenAI, AI, ML, GNNs, and Data Science.
- **Languages:** Python, Go, JS, and SQL.
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Django, and Node.js.
- **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
- **Tools:** Git, LATEX, VSCode, PyCharm, Jira, Docker, and Jupyter Notebook.

# My Journey

From crafting push notification solutions at Najva to designing robust software architectures at Gamelectronics, my journey as a Software Engineer has been marked by impactful contributions. At Najva, I enhanced advertising systems with cutting-edge push notification technologies. Later, at Gamelectronics, I spearheaded the redesign and optimization of the companyâ€™s software architecture, significantly improving documentation and document retrieval efficiency. Each role has been a step toward mastering innovative solutions that deliver real-world results.

# What Drives My Curiosity

My research interests lies at the intersection of Graph Neural Networks, Information Retrieval, Explainable AI (XAI), and Generative AI. I am passionate about developing models that bridge human understanding and machine learning, focusing on long text summarization, anomaly detection in complex networks, and generating meaningful data representations. I aim to explore how representation learning and GenAI can capture high-level semantics in attributed networks, improving explainability and real-world applicability. Additionally, I am intrigued by leveraging large language models and generative systems for cultural heritage preservation and digital twin systems, aspiring to uncover actionable insights from both structured and unstructured data.
