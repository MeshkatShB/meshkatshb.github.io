Hello everyone! My name is Meshkat, which means 'Lantern' in my native language. Welcome to my personal webpage!

Feel free to check out my **_GitHub repository_** here: [_GitHub_](https://github.com/meshkatshb)

I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Engineering** and a Master's degree in **Information Technology Engineering** from the [_University of Tehran_](https://ut.ac.ir), [_College of Interdisciplinary Sciences and Technology_](https://cist.ut.ac.ir), graduating with a GPA of 3.61/4.0. My Master's thesis titled: **"Text Summarization with Graph Neural Networks,"** explored scalable methods for long-text summarization and highlighted the importance of transparent AI models.. My research interests include _Large Language Models_, _Natural Language Processing_, _Artificial Intelligence (AI)_, _Machine Learning (ML)_, _Social Network Analysis_, and _Software Engineering_.

> I am currently looking for PhD positions in Europe in the field of Generative AI, NLP, Software Engineering, and Graphs.

I have actively contributed to the `browser-use/web-ui` open-source project, implementing key features such as a `RAG implementation` and functionality for saving and using user settings to enhance the overall experience. I also focused on improving system stability by addressing critical issues, including resolving exceptions and fixing errors like `UnboundLocalError`.

My contributions extended to backend optimizations, such as adding necessary packages to the Dockerfile, integrating a base URL for ChatOllama to interact with remote servers, and introducing an LLM provider with default model settings to suppress warnings. Additionally, I streamlined the codebase through cleanup efforts and updated documentation, ensuring the project is maintainable and scalable for future development.

# My Journey

From crafting push notification solutions at Najva to designing robust software architectures at Gamelectronics, my journey as a Software Engineer has been marked by impactful contributions. At Najva, I enhanced advertising systems with cutting-edge push notification technologies.

Later, at Gamelectronics, I spearheaded the redesign and optimization of the company’s software architecture, significantly improving documentation and document retrieval efficiency. Each role has been a step toward mastering innovative solutions that deliver real-world results.

# What Drives My Curiosity

My research interests lies at the intersection of Graph Neural Networks, Information Retrieval, Explainable AI (XAI), and Generative AI. I am passionate about developing models that bridge human understanding and machine learning, focusing on long text summarization, anomaly detection in complex networks, and generating meaningful data representations.

I aim to explore how representation learning and GenAI can capture high-level semantics in attributed networks, improving explainability and real-world applicability. Additionally, I am intrigued by leveraging large language models and generative systems for cultural heritage preservation and digital twin systems, aspiring to uncover actionable insights from both structured and unstructured data.
