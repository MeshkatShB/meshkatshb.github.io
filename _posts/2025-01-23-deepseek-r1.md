## Setup and Usage

### Using DeepSeek R1 with RooCline

RooCline, a fork of the popular Klein framework, officially supports DeepSeek R1, offering a robust architecture mode for streamlined workflows.

1. **Install the Rine Extension:**

   - Available on the VS Code Marketplace. Update to the latest version if already installed.

2. **Profile Creation:**

   - Navigate to settings and create a new profile. Name it for easy identification.
   - Select the **DeepSeek Reasoner** as the model and input your API key.

3. **Architect Mode:**

   - Use R1 as an "architect" to create detailed plans for projects.
   - Example: R1 can generate a detailed plan for a playable synth keyboard or web interface.

4. **Combining Models:**
   - Use R1 for planning and DeepSeek V3 for implementation to optimize cost and speed.
   - V3 executes tasks based on the architectural plan, ensuring efficiency.

### Using DeepSeek R1 with Aider

Aider also supports DeepSeek R1, making it a great option for coding workflows.

1. **Configuration:**

   - Set up an `aider_config` file with:
     - Architect model: DeepSeek R1.
     - Edit model: DeepSeek V3 or as preferred.

2. **Task Execution:**

   - Example: Request a one-page HTML chat interface using OpenAI's API.
   - R1 generates the architecture plan, while the edit model (e.g., V3) codes the solution.

3. **Real-time Implementation:**
   - Example: Create a functional and visually appealing interface in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Adjust and refine the design directly using Aider's flexible workflows.
