## 2. How Does Deep Research Work?

Unlike traditional chat models that provide **quick but shallow** responses, Deep Research follows a **structured** and **multi-step** research process:

1️⃣ **User Inputs Query** – Users specify a research topic (optionally attaching files).  
2️⃣ **AI Clarifies Details** – The agent asks follow-up questions to refine the scope.  
3️⃣ **Autonomous Research Begins** – AI searches, extracts, and organizes key information.  
4️⃣ **Data Processing & Analysis** – AI **synthesizes findings**, runs **data calculations**, and **creates visualizations**.  
5️⃣ **Comprehensive Report Delivered** – Users receive a **detailed research document with citations**.

📌 **Processing Time:** Typically takes **5–30 minutes**, depending on complexity.
