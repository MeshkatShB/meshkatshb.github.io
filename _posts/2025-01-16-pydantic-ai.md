## Key Features

### 1. Type Safety and Validation

PydanticAI enforces strict type definitions, ensuring that LLM outputs conform to expected formats. This is especially important in applications requiring high precision, such as financial systems or legal document analysis.

### 2. Structured Responses

The framework excels in creating organized, schema-compliant outputs, making it ideal for scenarios like task management or data-driven workflows.

### 3. Dependency Injection

A novel type-safe system allows for customization of proxy behavior and facilitates testing-driven development.

### 4. Model-Agnostic Architecture

Supports multiple LLM providers, including OpenAI, Gemini, and others, while providing a simple interface for additional model support.

### 5. Streaming Response Processing

PydanticAI processes and validates streaming responses in real-time, including structured data validation during streaming, ensuring reliability in dynamic systems.

### 6. Integration with Logfire

Seamless integration with Logfire enhances debugging and monitoring capabilities, giving developers real-time insights into the operation of their AI agents.

## Getting Started

To begin using PydanticAI, install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pydantic-ai
```

## Example Usage:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, LLM, Prompt

class CustomAgent(Agent):
    llm = LLM(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")
    prompt = Prompt("Summarize the following document:")
```
