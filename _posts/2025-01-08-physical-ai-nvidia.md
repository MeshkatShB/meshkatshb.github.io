NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang recently introduced a groundbreaking vision for **Physical AI**, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize industries such as robotics and autonomous vehicles. This evolution extends beyond generative and agentic AI, focusing on embodied intelligence capable of interacting with the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** represents the integration of AI systems into physical environments, enabling them to perceive, reason, and act in real-world scenarios. Unlike generative AI, which processes and produces digital outputs, Physical AI brings intelligence into self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and general robotics.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Embodied Intelligence**: AI systems with physical capabilities, such as autonomous vehicles and robots.
- **World Models**: AI trained on real-world dynamics like gravity, friction, and object permanence.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: The use of digital twins and simulations to train AI for physical tasks.
