As we look toward 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve at a rapid pace. For full video, check out this link: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zuF4Ys1eAw&t=59s&ab_channel=IBMTechnology). Here's a breakdown of eight critical trends shaping the future of AI, based on educated predictions:

## 1. Agentic AI

AI agents capable of reasoning, planning, and taking action will become increasingly prominent. These systems can create multi-step plans, interact with tools, and handle complex tasks. However, current models struggle with consistent logical reasoning and multi-variable scenarios, emphasizing the need for better models in 2025.

## 2. Inference Time Compute

AI models are extending their capabilities during inference, allowing for variable "thinking time" based on task complexity. This advancement enables smarter AI agents through:

- Improved **training data** for reasoning at training time.
- Enhanced **chain-of-thought processing** during inference.

---

## 3. Very Large Models

The size of AI models is set to grow exponentially, with parameters potentially exceeding **50 trillion**. These enormous models will push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.

---

## 4. Very Small Models

On the flip side, smaller models with a few billion parameters will gain traction. These models can efficiently perform specific tasks and operate on personal devices like laptops and smartphones, reducing the need for extensive computational resources.

---

## 5. Advanced Use Cases

AI will address more sophisticated enterprise needs, including:

- **Customer service bots** capable of solving complex problems.
- **IT optimization** and automation.
- **Adaptive cybersecurity** tools that respond to new threats in real-time.

---

## 6. Near Infinite Memory

Advancements in **context windows** will allow AI systems to maintain comprehensive memory, enabling:

- Bots to recall every interaction with a user.
- Improved personalization in customer service and other domains.

---

## 7. Human-in-the-Loop Augmentation

Collaboration between humans and AI needs refinement. Studies show that AI often outperforms humans, but combined efforts can fall short due to poor integration. In 2025, expect:

- Better systems for **seamless AI augmentation** in professional workflows.
- Tools that simplify AI usage without requiring domain expertise.
