# LLM Zero to Mastery

**About:**  
This repository is a comprehensive guide to mastering Large Language Models (LLMs) through hands-on projects. It provides step-by-step implementations of advanced techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning GPT models, and instruction-tuning. Each module is designed to help users effectively learn and apply LLM concepts with practical examples.

## Structure

### 1. Local-RAG

**Directory:** `Local-RAG/`  
This module demonstrates the implementation of a simple local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Key steps include:

- **PDF Processing:** Extracts text from PDF files in the `./data` directory.
- **Vector Database Creation:** Creates and stores vectorized representations of documents.
- **Query Handling:** Retrieves relevant documents based on user queries using a vector database.
- **Response Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI's Ollama model to generate contextually accurate responses.

**Outcome:** Enables local document-based Q&A systems, making it a practical tool for managing and querying personal data collections.

### 2. Fine-Tuning GPT-2

**Directory:** `Fine-Tuning-GPT2/`  
This module focuses on fine-tuning GPT-2 for custom tasks. The workflow includes:

- **Dataset Preparation:** Loads, tokenizes, and processes text datasets.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Adjusts GPT-2 on task-specific data using Hugging Face's Trainer API.
- **Model Testing and Evaluation:** Assesses performance with custom prompts and task examples.
- **Model Saving:** Saves the fine-tuned model locally for reuse.

**Outcome:** Customizes GPT-2 to generate domain-specific text, making it suitable for tailored applications.

### 3. Instruction-Tuning

**Directory:** `instruction_tuning/`  
This module introduces instruction-tuning, a method to align LLM outputs with specific tasks using task-specific instructions and examples. Key features include:

- **Data Preparation:** Converts datasets into instruction-response pairs.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Leverages pre-trained transformer models to train on task-specific instructions.
- **Evaluation:** Tests the modelâ€™s alignment and performance on user-defined tasks.

**Outcome:** Produces LLMs refined for instruction-based tasks, significantly improving their alignment to specific needs.
